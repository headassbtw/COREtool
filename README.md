Killzone 2 I swear to fucking god, you have the DRIPPIEST goons I've ever seen, and have a file format nobody's cracked in a decade.

## Why?
Killzone 2 does mesh skinning on the PS3's SPUs, meaning I can't get the unmodified models. This is also a problem because I can't seem to rip the mesh in renderdoc either.

That brings us here, me being way out of my depth just so I can rip some models.
